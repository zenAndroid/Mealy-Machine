# What this is:
- A rudimentary (read: not general yet, and with a decent amount of parameters tweaked) model of an abstract Mealy Machine.
- This project is a sub-goal for another, as-yet undisclosed application that uses mealy machine to run its business logic,=.
- Thus, these objects and classes are merely for testing the functionality of this idea.

## A note about the PUML file:

The plantUML file was NOT autogenerated, and it holds the basic structure of the classes.

Each class has a method called StdGettersSetters, that is a convention i took to avoid having to list the getters and the setters for *all* of the properties.
The getter/setters pairs I omitted __are the bare-bones ones that do _nothing_ but get/set the property__.
The more interesting ones (ie: the ones that use var-arg syntax or that generally perform an operation in addition to get/setting the propety are well documented).
